# Lections
Repository for lections. Also [cpp repository](https://github.com/nikitaevg/cpp-course) contains lections for the second and third semesters about C++. 
All these lections are just my notes which I were asked to place here. Of course, they do not pretend to be complete lections for these subjects.
